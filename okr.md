# Community Committee Objectives and Key Results

The PSF Community Committee uses Objectives and Key Results to try to provide direction and guidance to the work we to, enabling our own work and the work of our initiatives to have a north star for us to ensure we're working towards.

## Key Concepts

OKRs consist of two elements:

- Objectives
  - Objectives are qualatative, ambitious, and memorable definitions of the things we as a committee would like to achieve.
- Key Results
  - Key Results are a set of metrics by which we can measure progress toward their objectives. Like objectives, they should be ambitious and overestimate what we can accomplish.
